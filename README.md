# Just A Bill 

## Description
Just A Bill is a web application designed to allow the user to view bills that have become law, and save favorites.   Data is populated via [The ProPublica Data Store](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/bills/#get-recent-bills-by-a-specific-subject). 

This project is a part of the Front End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. You can find the specs for it [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html).  This is a solo project and I was provided 1 week to complete the project, including functionality and testing.  

## Installation
Create a directory for the project and cd into it.

Clone down the repo for this project:

``` git clone git@github.com:saraebbers/justabill.git```

```npm install```

```npm start```

In order to run locally you will also need to apply for an API key [here](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/). This key should live in a file called `apiKey.js` in the `utils` directory.

For example:
```
export const apiKey = //Your key here//
```
